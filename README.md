# Wolfenstein/DOOM style software renderers

![project screenshot](screen/image.png)

* `src/main_doom.c`: a DOOM-style software renderer
* `src/main_wolf.c`: a Wolfenstein 3D-style software renderer

### Building & Running

`$ make doom|wolf|all`, binaries are `bin/doom` and `bin/wolf` respectively

### Note

This is a fork of jdah's program with the makefile and src altered so it succesfully compiles on a Fedora 37 system with SDL2 installed.
I suspect it will work similarly for any mainstream linux distribution.
